# TRGT: Tandem Repeat Genotyper

TRGT is a tool for targeted genotyping of tandem repeats from PacBio HiFi data.
In addition to the basic size genotyping, TRGT profiles sequence composition,
mosaicism, and CpG methylation of each analyzed repeat. TRGT comes with a
companion tool TRVZ for visualization of reads overlapping the repeats.

## Early version warning

Please note that TRGT is still in early development. We are still tweaking the
input / output file formats and making changes that can affect the behavior of
the program.

## Availability

- TRGT and TRVZ Linux binaries are [available here](https://github.com/PacificBiosciences/trgt/releases)
- Repeat definition files are [available here](repeats/)
