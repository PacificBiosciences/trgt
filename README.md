# TRGT: Tandem Repeat Genotyper

TRGT is a tool for targeted genotyping of tandem repeats from PacBio HiFi data.
In addition to the basic size genotyping, TRGT profiles sequence composition,
mosaicism, and CpG methylation of each analyzed repeat. TRGT comes with a
companion tool TRVZ for visualization of reads overlapping the repeats.

## Availability
