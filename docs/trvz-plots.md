# Interpreting TRVZ plots

In this tutorial, you will learn how to interpret the read pileup plots
generated by TRVZ.

## Background

TRVZ is a companion visualization program for TRGT. TRVZ can:

- Create allele plots that depict repeat alleles and reads aligning to them
  (`--plot-type allele`, default).
- Create waterfall plots that depict portions of HiFi reads spanning the repeat
  without aligning them (`--plot-type waterfall`). The waterfall plots are
  especially convenient for visualizing mosaicism.
- Color code the repeat structure on allele and waterfall plots
  (`--show motifs`, default).
- Display 5mCpG methylation levels on allele and waterfall plots (`--show meth`).

In the remainder of this document we will go over examples of TRVZ plots.

## An HTT repeat in the HG002 sample

This example concerns a repeat region in the *HTT* gene. This region contains
two tandem repeats, one consists of CAGs and the other consists of CCGs. The
expansions of the CAG repeat are known to cause Huntington's disease.

The allele plot below consists of two panels, each corresponding to a haplotype
of this region. The first track of each panel depicts the haplotype consensus sequence.
The CAG and CCG repeats are shown in blue and purple respectively. The CAG
repeat is depicted as a solid blue color block meaning that this repeat
consists of uninterrupted stretch of CAG motifs. The gray bar inside the purple
block corresponding to the CCG repeat indicates that the second motif of this
repeat has an interruption. (Deletions and insertions in the haplotype sequence
relative to the perfect, uninterrupted repeat are also shown when they are
present.) Subsequent tracks depict alignments of HiFi reads to the consensus
allele sequence. Any mismatches, insertions, and deletions are indicated by gray
bars, vertical lines, and horizontal lines respectively.

The waterfall plot below depicts the same set of reads as the allele plot above.
It depicts portions of reads spanning the repeat region without aligning them.
The perfect copies of the CAG and CCG motifs are depicted in blue and purple
respectively. The remaining portions of the read sequences are colored in gray.
